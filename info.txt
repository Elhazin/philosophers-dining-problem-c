What you will get from this  project is a better understanding of how to use the following:

Threads and how to use them to make your program more efficient and faster. and you will learn how to work with the following functions: `pthread_create` and `pthread_join`, ` pthread_mutex_init`, `pthread_mutex_lock`, `pthread_mutex_unlock`.
you will learn how to use semaphores and how to work with the following functions: `sem_init`, `sem_wait`, `sem_post`. 
how cpu scheduling the threads and how it manaaage the threads.

you will learn the following concepts:

what is the difference between process and thread.
what is the difference between mutex and semaphore.
what is the difference between `pthread_create` and `pthread_join`.
what is the difference between `sem_init`, `sem_wait`, `sem_post`.
what is the difference between `pthread_mutex_init`, `pthread_mutex_lock`, `pthread_mutex_unlock`.


## How to use the program

1. clone the repo.
2. open the terminal and go to the directory of the project.
3. use the commmand make to compile the program.    
4. run the program using the following command: `./philo`
5. give the program the number of philosophers you want to run the program with.
like this: `./philo 5 800 200 200` where 5 is the number of philosophers, 800 is the time to die, 200 is the time to eat and 200 is the time to sleep.
